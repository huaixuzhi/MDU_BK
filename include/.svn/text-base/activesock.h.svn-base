 * Active socket is a higher level abstraction to the ioqueue. It provides
 * automation to socket operations which otherwise would have to be done
 * manually by the applications. For example with socket recv(), recvfrom(),
 * and accept() operations, application only needs to invoke these
 * operation once, and it will be notified whenever data or incoming TCP
 * connection (in the case of accept()) arrives.
